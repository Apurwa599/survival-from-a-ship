## Survival Prediction from a Ship using Machine Learning
In this project, I focused on predicting whether a passenger survived a ship disaster or not.
The prediction is performed using historical passenger data and a supervised machine learning approach. 
The project demonstrates a complete ML workflow including data loading, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
